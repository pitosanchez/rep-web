# REP — Rare Renal Equity Project

## The One-Sentence Pitch
A public accountability platform that maps how where you live shapes kidney disease outcomes — connecting genetics, neighborhood conditions, and patient stories to expose structural inequity.

## What It Does
REP answers a question institutions avoid:

**"If the science is known, why is the harm still predictable by ZIP code?"**

It's an interactive map-based platform that shows:

- **Where** APOL1-mediated kidney disease and FSGS cluster (by census tract, not individuals)
- **What structural conditions** exist there — poverty rates, fast food density, liquor store concentration, distance to nephrology care, transit burden
- **What patients and caregivers report** — anonymous stories tied to geography, displayed only when enough people share the same experience

## What Makes It Different

| Most Platforms | REP |
|---|---|
| Show patient stories as emotional content | Treats stories as spatial evidence |
| Map disease as dots on individuals | Maps neighborhood patterns, never individuals |
| Separate data from lived experience | Combines both in one view |
| Built for awareness | Built for accountability — cite it in grants, use it in policy meetings |

## The Core Pages

### 1. Hero / Home
- **"Where You Live Shapes Kidney Disease"**
- Establishes authority, explains the mission
- Two paths: Explore the Map / Share Your Experience

### 2. Map Explorer
- Interactive MapLibre map of census tracts
- Choropleth layers (poverty, food environment, alcohol density)
- POI overlays (fast food, liquor stores, dialysis centers)
- Click a tract → open its profile

### 3. Neighborhood Profile (/neighborhood/[geoid])
The signature page. Shows:
- Burden index, travel time to care, exposure index
- **"What Patients and Caregivers Report"**
  - Aggregated themes (travel burden, delayed referrals, etc.)
  - Anonymous quotes from that neighborhood
  - Only visible when threshold is met (minimum 5 submissions)

### 4. Stories & Place
- Submission form for patients and caregivers with APOL1 or FSGS
- Guided prompts (not open-ended trauma mining)
- Tied to ZIP/tract, anonymous by default
- Consent language built in

### 5. About
- Why REP exists
- Ethical commitments (no individual dots, small-number suppression, etc.)
- Who it's for (patients, advocates, researchers, funders, journalists, policymakers)

### 6. Methods
- Data sources
- How thresholds work
- What REP can and cannot say
- IRB/funder-safe language

## Who It's For

| Audience | What They Get |
|---|---|
| Patients & families | Context — "I'm not alone, and it's not my fault" |
| Community advocates | Evidence to cite, not just testimony to share |
| Researchers | Neighborhood-level patterns to investigate |
| Journalists | A story that writes itself — place, data, and voice |
| Funders | A platform that shows where investment is needed |
| Policymakers | Structural visibility they can't ignore |

## The Ethical Architecture

✓ **No individual-level disease dots** — ever
✓ **Census tracts, not people** — patterns, not surveillance
✓ **Stories appear only when patterns emerge** — minimum threshold before display
✓ **Anonymous by default** — geography over identity
✓ **Clear limits** — every page explains what the data can and can't say

## The Visual Tone

- **Editorial authority** — like ProPublica or The Marshall Project
- **Human warmth** — not clinical, not cold
- **Calm confidence** — no hype, no pleading
- **Community-centered** — built with, not for

**Color palette:** warm cream background, deep charcoal text, terracotta accent (#c45a3b)
